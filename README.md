# EEG-Brainwave-Emotion-classification-using-Bi-LSTM

This is a Jupyter Notebook that uses a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network to classify emotions based on EEG brainwave data.

## Description
The notebook uses EEG brainwave data collected from sensors placed on participants' scalps to classify their emotional states. The data includes information on the power spectral density (PSD) of the brainwaves across different frequency bands. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training and testing, and an evaluation of the model's performance.

The Bi-LSTM neural network is chosen for its ability to capture temporal dependencies in the data, which are important for accurately classifying emotions.

## Installation
To run the notebook, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your local machine. You can download Jupyter Notebook from the official website: https://jupyter.org/install.html

Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, you can download the notebook file from this GitHub repository and open it in Jupyter Notebook.

You will also need to have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
tensorflow
sklearn
seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip or conda.

## Usage
To use the notebook, open it in Jupyter Notebook and run each cell in order. The notebook includes detailed comments and explanations for each step of the process.

You can also modify the notebook to use your own EEG data or adjust the model parameters to improve the classification accuracy.

## Data
The EEG data used in this notebook is from the DEAP dataset, which can be downloaded from: http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/

The data is preprocessed to extract features related to the power spectral density (PSD) of the brainwaves in different frequency bands.
